- **`results/`**: Generated outputs such as graphs, metrics, and reports.

## 🚀 Projects

This repository contains the following key data science projects:

### 1. **Customer Churn Prediction**
- **Description**: A machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical data such as usage patterns, demographics, and customer interactions.
- **Technologies**: `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`
- **Goal**: Predict the probability of a customer leaving a service.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis with NLP**
- **Description**: An NLP project that classifies the sentiment of customer reviews (positive, negative, neutral) using a variety of machine learning techniques.
- **Technologies**: `Python`, `transformers`, `Hugging Face`
- **Goal**: Understand customer sentiment from reviews or feedback.

### 3. **Financial Risk Prediction**
- **Description**: A model to predict financial risks, such as defaults, based on transaction data and customer profiles.
- **Technologies**: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Logistic Regression`, `LLM`, `RAG`
- **Goal**: Calculate the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan.
